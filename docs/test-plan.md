# Vesta test plan (VST-52)

Version 1, 1 November 2026. Owner: Ahmed. Reviewer: Manar.

This is one test plan for both apps (Flutter and React Native). Every test is run on **both** apps, on a **real phone**, with the same steps and the same expected result. It is used in Sprint 3 (real-phone testing) and in the buffer (final tests), and it is the proof of the tests in the final report.

**How to use it**

1. Read the real-phone checklist and prepare the two test accounts and the test data.
2. Run the tests of a section in order. Follow the numbered steps exactly.
3. In the **Flutter** and **React Native** columns write `Pass`, `Fail` or `Not tested`. If a feature does not exist yet in one app, leave `Not tested`.
4. Fill in your name, the date and the phone model. If a test fails, create a Jira bug and write it in the bug table at the end.

Specification used for the expected results: `docs/user-stories.md`, `docs/offer-types.md`, `docs/data-model.md`. Where the expected result is not clear it is listed in "Questions for Manar" at the end.

## Real-phone checklist

- [ ] Phone model and Android version written in the Phone model column (example: Xiaomi Redmi Note 13, Android 15).
- [ ] Wi-Fi tested, and mobile data tested (at least the sign-in and the map).
- [ ] Permissions to test: location, photos or camera (profile and listing photos), notifications (Android 13 or newer asks).
- [ ] A second phone (or an emulator) is ready for the chat and notification tests.
- [ ] Phone language switched to English, French and Arabic for LNG-01.
- [ ] **Flutter app:** debug build with `flutter run` (app id `com.vesta.flutterapp.debug`, it installs next to the Play Store version), or the release APK (`flutter build apk --release`, see `flutter-app/README.md`). Do **not** install the release APK on a phone that has the Google Play test version.
- [ ] **React Native app:** install Expo Go from Google Play, run `npm install` and `npm start` in `react-native-app/`, fill `.env` (ask Manar for the values, never commit it) and scan the QR code on the same Wi-Fi as the computer.
- [ ] Both apps use the same Firebase project.

## Test accounts and test data

Create two accounts in the apps (any email you can access, password of 6 characters or more): **A** is the owner, **B** is the buyer or tenant. Use Tunisian data:

| Offer | Title | City | Price | Details |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sale | Villa à Hammamet | Hammamet | 650000 TND | villa, area 220 m², 2 photos |
| Rent | Appartement S+2 à La Marsa | La Marsa | 1200 TND per month | apartment, area 95 m², furnished |
| Stay | Riad à Tozeur | Tozeur | 120 TND per night | riad, 4 guests, 2 beds, wifi and ac |
| Stay | Maison d'hôtes à Sidi Bou Said | Sidi Bou Said | 180 TND per night | guest house, 2 guests, 1 bed |

Phone numbers use the format `+216XXXXXXXX`. Use photos from the gallery of the phone, and one photo larger than 5 MB.

## Authentication
Accounts A (owner) and B (buyer) are created in AUTH-01. Password: 6 characters or more.

| AUTH-01 | Sign up | 1. Open the app signed out.<br>2. Tap Sign up.<br>3. Enter a name, a new email and a password of 6 characters or more.<br>4. Tap Sign up. | The account is created, the user is signed in and sees the home screen. | Not tested | Not tested | | | |
| AUTH-02 | Sign up with wrong data | 1. Open Sign up.<br>2. Try each of these: an invalid email (`abc`), a password shorter than 6 characters, an email that already has an account.<br>3. Tap Sign up each time. | Each attempt stays on the screen with a clear error message in the app language. No account is created. | Not tested | Not tested | | | |
| AUTH-03 | Log in | 1. Open Log in.<br>2. Enter the email and password of account A.<br>3. Tap Log in. | The user is signed in and sees the home screen. The name of A is shown in Profile. | Not tested | Not tested | | | |
| AUTH-04 | Log in with a wrong password | 1. Open Log in.<br>2. Enter the email of A and a wrong password.<br>3. Tap Log in. | An error message is shown, the user stays on Log in and is not signed in. No crash. | Not tested | Not tested | | | |
| AUTH-05 | Session is kept | 1. Log in as A.<br>2. Close the app completely (swipe it away from the recent apps).<br>3. Open the app again. | The user is still signed in. The login screen is not shown. | Not tested | Not tested | | | |
| AUTH-06 | Log out | 1. Log in as A.<br>2. Open Profile and tap Log out.<br>3. Close and reopen the app. | The user is signed out and the app does not sign in again. Publish, Chat and Favorites ask to sign in. | Not tested | Not tested | | | |

After step 4 the user comes back to the same screen. | Not tested | Not tested | | | |

## Listings
Run these tests signed in as A unless the step says otherwise. Offer types and fields: `docs/offer-types.md`.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LNG-01 | Default language | 1. Set the phone language to English, then install or reopen the app on a fresh install.<br>2.

The favorite is visible in both apps. | Not tested | Not tested | | | |

## Questions for Manar

These expected results are not clear in the specification. The tests above use the first answer until you decide.

1. **Price format.** `docs/offer-types.md` shows `120 000 TND`, while `formatPrice` (Sprint 1) gives `TND 120,000`. Which one is final? (LST-01, LNG-06)
2. **Listings near me.** The user story says "see listings near my current location". Is it in the MVP, and what exactly should the map or the list show? (no test yet)
3. **Own listing.** Should the owner see the Chat button on his own listing? (LST-07, CHT-01)
4. **Limits.** What are the maximum lengths of the title, the description and a chat message? (LST-05, CHT-05)
5. **Push notifications on the free plan.** How is the push sent to the other user, and what is expected when the app is closed? (NTF-02 to NTF-04)
6. **Deleted listing in Favorites.** Does it disappear or show as unavailable? (LST-09)
7. **Scope.** Are report a listing, block a user, booking request and visit request (VST-92) in the MVP? If yes I add the test cases.
